# how to write checkers for codebreaker

### without `testlib.h`

If you are not using `testlib.h`, checker is called with $3$ arguments in this order:

- input file (`argv[1]`)
- participant output file (`argv[2]`)
- jury output file (`argv[3]`)

The checker should output a real number between $0$ and $1$. The score will be multiplied by the subtask score.

### with `testlib.h`

If you are using `testlib.h`

the following is behaviour of the modified `testlib.h` (modification is in `InStream::quit` function starting at line 2596)

- `_ok`: prints 1
- `_wa`: prints 0
- `_pe`: prints 0
- `_fail`: prints nothing (checker fail)
- `_dirt`: prints 0
- `_points`: prints custom error message that you specified. Example use is `quitf(_points,"%.2f\n",0.69420);` to give $69.42\%$ of the subtask score
- `__unexpected_eof`: prints 0
